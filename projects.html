<h4>Augmented Reality Games for Rehabilitation</h4>
In my undergrad senior design project, I have worked on augmented reality games, specifically designed for patients that need upper-limb rehabilitation.</p><p> Our project won the third place prize among other ECE projects at the end of that year. You can learn more about this <a href="http://www.engr.colostate.edu/ece-sr-design/AY11/rehabilitation/index.shtml" target="_blank">here.</a></p><p>Our team was also on the engineering college <a href="http://www.engr.colostate.edu/comm/pubs/pdf/Collaboration_2012.pdf" target="_blank"> publication </a>that year.</p>

<h4>Web Controlled Car</h4>
<p>In Fall 2012, our final assignment in EC544 (Networking the Physical World) was to create something new using our knowledge we had learned in the class.
Prior to this, we had created a web controlled LED and autonomous (not so sophisticated) car among other projects. 
</p>
<p>So our team decided to create a web-controlled car as a combination of these assignments. We had to come up with a solution in a short time and implement it. Therefore we decided to use a netbook to control the car via internet. The netbook had a web-server installed, and whoever visited the webpage were able to control the car. We did a complete run around the first floor of Photonics building.</p>

<p> The website also had a webcam stream embedded in it, so the driver was able to see his actions in real time. Moreover a friend from India was able to access the car and control it for a while.</p>

<h4>Super Kids - A Java Swing Application</h4>
<p>Also in Fall 2012, as a group of 9 students we worked on a software engineering project. The goal of the project was to create an application for kids to explore and learn colors, shapes, animals etc. The application is created using JAVA and called Super Kids: The Ultimate Adventure. 
           <p>The kids part of the application consists of tutorial and question modes. Moreover, parents are able to add/edit/remove questions, review their children's progress and set achievements.</p> 
          <p> There were two teams splitting up GUI and back-end workload. The Github repository of this project can be found <a href="https://github.com/btevfik/super-kids" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

<h4>Fuddle - An Image Sharing Website</h4>
<p>In Spring 2013, we have created a website similar to Imgur, 9GAG and Pinterest. The website was created from ground up using ASP.NET and C#. On the client side we have extensively used javascript and jquery to create a richer user experience. Some open source jquery projects such as JCrop were included into our website as well. I was heavily involved in the overall visual design and structure of the website mainly using CSS and HTML. I was also involved in many aspects of the server-side coding dealing with AJAX requests, functions to update database entries and ASP.NET controls and searching functionality.</p> 
<p> Main functions of the website enables a user to register, login, upload pictures to their profile, edit their profile, create albums, comment and rate other users' pictures and search pictures and users in the website.
</p><p>We have deployed our website on AppHarbor for demo and test purposes. The demo can be found at <a href="http://fuddle.apphb.com" target="_blank">fuddle.apphb.com</a>.</p>
